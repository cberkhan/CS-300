# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For the two projects in this course, I needed to create a program that could read through a file, enter the information 
into a data structure of my choosing, and then output the information in alphanumeric order. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I first began writing pseudocode for three data structures: vector, hash table, and binary search tree, then completed
a runtime analysis on each data structure, and then made my decision on which data structure would be best. Data structures
are important to understand because if I am ever using them for any sort of program or project, it is important to understand how they 
run/work and how to input and retrieve information from the data structure. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame roadblocks by reviewing the textbook and the videos provided. I was very lost at the beginning of the term, but now if
I go back to the activities, I actually understand the program and how it works. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I did not have much knowledge on any of the three data structures covered in this course when we first began; however, I now 
feel confident in my understanding of the data structures and if I ever come in contact with a program that utilizes data structures, I will
have a better understanding of the code. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I believe the way I code is cleaner and the comments are more informative for the reader on the code I am writing.
